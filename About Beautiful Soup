What is Beautiful Soup:
- Beautiful Soup is a Python library for parsing structured data. It allows you to interact with HTML in a similar way to how you would interact with a web page
using developer tools. Beautiful Soup exposes a couple of intuitive functions you can use to explore the HTML you received. 

Beautiful Soup:
- Beautiful Soup provides a few simple methods and Pythonic idioms for navigating, searching, and modifying a parse tree: a toolkit for dissecting a document and 
extracting what you need. It doesn’t take much code to write an application.

- Beautiful Soup automatically converts incoming documents to Unicode and outgoing documents to UTF-8. You don’t have to think about encodings, unless the document doesn’t specify an encoding and Beautiful Soup can’t autodetect one. Then you just have to specify the original encoding.

- Beautiful Soup sits on top of popular Python parsers like lxml and html5lib, allowing you to try out different parsing strategies or trade speed for flexibility.

Install Beautiful Soup:
pip install requests
pip install html5lib
pip install bs4
