- Selenium is an umbrella project for a range of tools and libraries that 
enable and support the automation of web browsers.

- It provides extensions to emulate user interaction with browsers,
a distribution server for scaling browser allocation, and the infrastructure for 
implementations of the W3C WebDriver specification that lets you write interchangeable 
code for all major web browsers.

- From there, we use Selenium to crawl data from web even though it's mostly an automated
web testing tool, not much about scraping data.
