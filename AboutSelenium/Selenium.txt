- Selenium is an umbrella project for a range of tools and libraries that 
enable and support the automation of web browsers.

- It provides extensions to emulate user interaction with browsers,
a distribution server for scaling browser allocation, and the infrastructure for 
implementations of the W3C WebDriver specification that lets you write interchangeable 
code for all major web browsers.

- From there, we use Selenium to crawl data from web even though it's mostly an automated
web testing tool, not much about scraping data.

- Selenium Installation:
    + First, your computer needs to have Python (we're using Python 3) and Pip
    (if not, please visit https://realpython.com/installing-python/ to install Python
    and https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/install-pip-windows/ to install Pip)
    + Then in the command window (or Terminal) type:
        pip install selenium
    to install Selenium
    + Another thing to do is to download the webdriver (here we use the browser Google Chrome)
    (You can download the Google Chrome webdriver that compatible with your computer OS from here
    https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
